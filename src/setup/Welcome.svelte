    Welcome to the dad game!
    Here, you can simulate all the fun and excitement of being a dad,
    without actually getting sicked on. Unless you're already a dad,
    in which case you're playing this whilst covered in sick.

    Just like in real life, you'll be presented with a series of challenges
    and will have to decide how best to react to each one. And just like in
    real life, each decision will be a trade-off. The trick is to meet your
    little cherub's every need whilst making sure your vital statistics
    don't fall to dangerous levels. If they do, it's game over man!
